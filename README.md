# metaFirstHTMLCSS
Completion work of the 4th course of the professional certificate for Developed Front-end of Meta. Module: HTML and CSS in depth.

In this project I worked only with HTML and CSS functions. But, I believe that very soon I will be making an updated version with all the JS functions.

Here you will find 4 different navigation pages. The fictio client was one of the logo options that was made available by Meta. I chose this client after I believed it would be interesting to find the photos to compose the site.
